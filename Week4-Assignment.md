# 🔄 Week 4: Deep Dive into MERN Stack Integration

## 🚀 Objective
Build a full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) application that demonstrates seamless integration between front-end and back-end components, including database operations, API communication, and state management.

## 📂 Tasks

### Task 1: Project Setup✅
- Set up a project with a clear directory structure for both client and server
- Configure MongoDB connection using Mongoose
- Set up Express.js server with necessary middleware
- Create a React front-end using Vite and configure proxy for API calls
- Implement environment variables for configuration management

### Task 2: Back-End Development✅
- Design and implement a RESTful API for a blog application with the following endpoints:
  - `GET /api/posts`: Get all blog posts✅
  - `GET /api/posts/:id`: Get a specific blog post✅
  - `POST /api/posts`: Create a new blog post✅
  - `PUT /api/posts/:id`: Update an existing blog post✅
  - `DELETE /api/posts/:id`: Delete a blog post✅
  - `GET /api/categories`: Get all categories✅
  - `POST /api/categories`: Create a new category;✅
- Create Mongoose models for `Post` and `Category` with proper relationships✅
- Implement input validation using a library like Joi or express-validator✅
- Add error handling middleware for API routes✅

### Task 3: Front-End Development
- Create React components for:
  - Post list view✅
  - Single post view✅
  - Create/edit post form✅
  - Navigation and layout✅✅
- Implement React Router for navigation between different views✅
- Use React hooks for state management (useState, useEffect, useContext)✅
- Create a custom hook for API calls✅

### Task 4: Integration and Data Flow
- Implement API service in React to communicate with the back-end✅
- Set up state management for posts and categories✅
- Create forms with proper validation for creating and editing posts✅
- Implement optimistic UI updates for better user experience
- Handle loading and error states for API calls

### Task 5: Advanced Features
- Add user authentication (registration, login, protected routes)✅
- Implement image uploads for blog post featured images✅
- Add pagination for the post list✅
- Implement searching and filtering functionality✅
- Add comments feature for blog posts

## 🧪 Expected Outcome
- A fully functional MERN stack blog application
- Proper integration between MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js
- Clean code organization with separation of concerns
- Responsive UI with good user experience
- Implementation of at least one advanced feature
